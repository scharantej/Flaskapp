 ## **Flask Application Design for Facebook App**

### **HTML Files**

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that will serve as the landing page of the Facebook app.
- It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display the user interface, such as buttons, text fields, and a container to display dynamic content.

**2. profile.html**
- This HTML file will display the user's profile information, such as name, profile picture, and other relevant details.
- It will be loaded dynamically when the user clicks on their profile button.

**3. friends.html**
- This HTML file will display the user's friends list.
- It will be loaded dynamically when the user clicks on the friends button.

### **Routes**

**1. @app.route('/')**
- This route will handle the main page of the Facebook app.
- It will render the index.html file.

**2. @app.route('/profile')**
- This route will handle the user's profile page.
- It will render the profile.html file and pass the user's profile information as variables.

**3. @app.route('/friends')**
- This route will handle the user's friends list page.
- It will render the friends.html file and pass the user's friends list as variables.

### **Additional Notes**

- The Flask application will require a database to store user information, such as profile details and friends list.
- The application will also need to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access their profile and friends list.
- The design provided here is a basic structure for a Facebook app using Flask. Additional features and functionalities can be added as per the specific requirements of the app.
